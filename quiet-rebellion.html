       <p>In fifth-period science, an eighth grader was caught sitting and doing his work. This, of course, appalled everyone around him, and he was put on indefinite suspension immediately. His teacher remarked on the downright disgusting situation; "It's unbelievable they think they can get away with this sort of thing. What is this generation coming to? Back in our day we would be throwing paper airplanes, yelling, and being nuisances. Not Listening to the teacher with our mouths shut and our attention focused! All this <i>respect</i> sickens me. Maybe I should just retire..." The teacher then looked upwards dreamily, and our reporters were unable to get any further comments. At press time, the child's parents were considering shipping him off to a military boot camp to "teach him how to be a good, disrespectful boy."</p>
