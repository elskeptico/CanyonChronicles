       <p>An absolutely genius kid brought a bb gun to school today, and everything went fine. Nothing happened, he didn't get in trouble, and everyone was happy! <br><i>yaaaaaay</i><br> More good things happened when he brought a BB shotgun, and then a BB knife! Things got even more fun when he brought a BB-longsword! It was super cool! It was then followed by a BB nuke, which everyone was BB-happy about before it BB-eradicated their BB-existence! BB-This BB-has BB-been BB-a BB-super BB-cool BB-article!</p>
