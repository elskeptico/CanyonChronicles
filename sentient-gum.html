        <p>Decades-old gum under desk gains sentience</p>

       <p>A piece of gum under a second-period english teacher's desk gained sentience today, shocking and further grossing out many students. One anonymous seventh grader was reportedly disappointed he could no longer chew said gum. "I just want this one thing! My family may be billionares, and I may go to school in a private jet, but I still feel entitled to this supposedly 'thinking' gum." At press time, the apparently well-off student was coaxing the gum into entering his mouth. <b>Interview with sentient gum coming soon!</b></p>
