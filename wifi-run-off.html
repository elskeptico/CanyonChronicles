       <p>The school Wi-Fi ran away again this morning, school IT guys say. "If this happens again, it'll be outside in the rain for a week! I can't stand its constant misbehaving. Maybe we should give it back..." Other staff members had their own opinions: "See, I don't understand the problem. If you don't want it, great, it's already gone!"  "The only problem is the leash. Just get a fancy new one! There are some cool ones online." At press time, the four grown adults were getting into a slap-fight over who gets the Wi-Fi.</p>
