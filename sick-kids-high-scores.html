        <p>Entire student body out sick - test scores rise</p>

       <p>A surprising, then worrying turn of events occured last Tuesday. Every single student was, in fact, sick, meaning there was no one at school. The teachers were all bamboozled, and one seventh grade math teacher decided to rise up and give the test anyway. Parents were delighted to receive greatly improved scores from what they were used to. Mr. Hendee was informed of the breakthrough and would like to change the test strategy to include this genius idea.</p>
