       <p>The urban legend slenderman was sighted this morning, hiding behind some trees close to the track. A student in first period PE wandered off to hang out. they just kinda hung out and talked about life. They high-fived and then the student went back to continue running. The student commented later: "Yeah man, he was just kinda a chill guy. I got his phone number if you wanna try it out!" After reporters called slenderman, they were invited to go get donuts at [REDACTED]. Oh, sorry, I mean [REDACTED]. ...huh. They did take video but it was <i>mysteriously corrupted</i>. The reporters confirmed slenderman was, in fact, a chill guy. Not unlike some aardvarks you may know.</p>
